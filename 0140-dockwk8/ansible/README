Repo to get k8s configured:

Repo source:
https://github.com/torgeirl/kubernetes-playbooks.git
This does not have docker.   So I have to figure how to 
get docker added without breaking the k8s

How to install kubernetes on ubuntu 22-04
and applied via ansible.

=============================================================


./startup.sh    - Start Master, Worker1, Worker2
./shutdown.sh   - stop master, worker, worker2

# Test nodes
ansible allnodes -i hosts -m ping

# Run playbook
ansible-playbook playbook-master.yml

=======================================
Trying to get master.yml to work.

I added the following into master.yml
    - name: Install acl
      apt:
        state: latest
        update_cache: true
        pkg:
        - acl

Attempted these onto
  ansible-playbook master.yml -i hosts

--extra-vars "ansible_become_pass=yourPassword"
--extra-vars "ansible_sudo_pass=yourPassword"

worked:
ansible-playbook -v  master.yml  -i hosts --extra-vars "ansible_sudo_pass=**ubuntupass**" --extra-vars "ansible_become_pass=**ubuntupass**"

worked:
ansible-playbook -v  master.yml  -i hosts --extra-vars "ansible_sudo_pass=**ubuntupass*"


Trying to figure out the environment info
First command:
ansible master -m ansible.builtin.setup -i hosts

From this
 "ansible_facts":"ansible_all_ipv4_addresses"[0]

 {{ ansible_facts['ansible_all_ipv4_addresses'][0] }}
