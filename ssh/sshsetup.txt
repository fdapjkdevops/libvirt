SSH Setup.

First setup your keys, or get them from anther machine.

Place the pub and private keys in ~/.ssh
Create a file ~/.ssh/config with content like is in this folder.


To test the connection to githut:
   ssh -T git@hithub.com-do
If you see a message such as:
   sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed for ED25519 "/home/fedavis/.ssh/id_ed25519_fdapjkdevops" from agent: agent refused operation
you need to set the permissions on your public/private keys.
The sign_and_send_pubkey was preventing things working.   To correct, I did
    chmod 600 id_ed25519_user        # private key
    chmod 644 id_ed25519_user.pub    # pub key
    

I wanted to clone my git location.
So I performed:
git clone git@github.com:pjkatz/ProjectNotes.git
It asked for my password to my keys, which I entered.

It then attemped
    Cloning into 'ProjectNotes'...
    sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed for ED25519 "fdavispa@gmail.com" from agent: agent refused operation
    sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed for ED25519 "fdapjkdevops@gmail.com" from agent: agent refused operation

    remote: Total 15 (delta 4), reused 10 (delta 2), pack-reused 0
    Receiving objects: 100% (15/15), done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (4/4), done.

This was neat.   It cycled through multiple keys in my set to find one that would work.

There are 3 keys.   github.com-pj, github.com-devops, github.com-do
    pj:     associates with id_ed25519_pjkat
    do:     with id_ed25519_fdapjdevops.

git remote add fdapjkdevops git@github.com-do:libvirt.git
--
-- 
Often issue if you are configured with https instead of git.
Check this will 
    git remote -v

git@github.com-do:fdapjkdevops/libvirt.git

Was using ssh -T git@github.com-do to test my key.
It stated it was authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
It also stated:
sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed for ED25519 "/home/fedavis/.ssh/id_ed25519_fdapjkdevops" from agent: agent refused operation
To correct, I did
    chmod 600 id_ed25519_user        # private key
    chmod 644 id_ed25519_user.pub    # pub key

To see the origina on the repo:
	git remote -v

#Still need to see how to change the URL, user, etc.
Probably something like:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git

Don't forget your git user, email.
-- Global
   git config --global user.name "First_Name Last_Name"
   git config --global user.email "bubbah@bubbagumpshrimp.com"
-- local folder
   git config user.name "First_name Last_Name"
   git config user.email "hello@home.com"
